## Definition (Closed)
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be **closed** if the set $X-A$ is open.


## Theorem 17.1
Let $(X,\mathfrak{T})$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold

(1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed.

(2)  Arbitrary intersections of closed set is closed.

(3) Finite union of closed sets are closed. i.e.,


<*proof*>

(1) $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed since their complements are $X$ and $\emptyset$, which are open.

(2) Let $\\{F_\alpha\\}_{\alpha\in\Lambda}$ be a collection of closed set. Then

$$
\begin{align*}
X-\bigcap_{\alpha\in\Lambda}F_\alpha &= X\cap\left(\bigcap_{\alpha\in\Lambda}F_\alpha\right)^c \\
&=X \cap \left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}F^c_\alpha \right) \\
&=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}\left(X\cap F^c_\alpha \right) \\
&=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}\left(X - F_\alpha \right) 
\end{align*}
$$
Since $X-F_\alpha$ is open and union of them are also open. Thus the arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.

(3) Let $F_1,\ldots, F_n$ be closed sets. 

$$
\begin{align*}
X-\bigcup_{i=1}^nF_i &= X\cap\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^nF_i \right)^c \\
&=X\cap \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^nF^c_i \right) \\ 
&=\bigcap_{i=1}^n(X\cap F^c_i) \\
&=\bigcap_{i=1}^n(X - F_i)
\end{align*}
$$

Since $X-F_i$ is open and finite intersections of open sets are open. Thus, the finite union of closed sets are closed.
