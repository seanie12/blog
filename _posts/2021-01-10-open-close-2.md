## Theorem 3.1.13
$U \subset \mathbb{R}$ is open $\Rightarrow$ $$\exists \{I_n\}$$: a finite or countable family of pairwise disjoint union of open intervals such that $U=\cup_n I_n.$

<*proof*>
Let $x \in U$ be given. Since $U$ is open, there is $\epsilon >0$ such that $(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) \subset U.$ Define $$A := \{t: t>x \text{ and } [x,t) \subset U\}, B:=\{s: s<x \text{ and } (s,x] \subset U\} .$$ Put $r_x := \sup A, l_x := \sup B$. We claim that $I_x= (l_x, r_x)\subset U$ and for $x,y \in U, I_x = I_y$ or $I_x \cap I_y =\emptyset.$ Suppose that $(l_x, r_x) \not\subset U.$ Without loss of generality, assume that $[x, r_x) \not\subset U,$ i.e. $r_x - \delta \not\in U$ with $x<r_x-\delta$ for some $\delta>0.$ Since $r_x = \sup A$, there exists $t_0$ such that $r_x\delta < x \leq r_x,$ i.e. $[x, r_x-\delta] \subset [x, r_x) \subset U$. It contradicts to the assumption that $r_x -\delta \not\in U$. 

$\therefore [x, r_x) \subset U.$
Similarly, we can show that $(l_x, x] \subset U.$

$\therefore  I_x = (l_x, r_x) \subset U.$

Now we want to show that for $x,y\in U$, $I_x = I_y$ or $I_x \cap I_y =\emptyset.$ Without the loss of generality assume that $x<y$. Suppose that $I_x \neq I_y$ and $I_x \cap I_y \neq \emptyset.$ Since $I_x \cap I_y \neq \emptyset$ and $x<y$, $l_y < r_x.$ Since $(l_x, r_x) \subset U, (l_x, l_y]\subset U.$ $$C:=\{q: q>y \text{ and } [y,q)\subset U \}, D:= \{p: p<y \text{ and } [p,y) \subset U \}.$$ For any $k\in (l_x, l_y], k\in U.$ i.e. $k\in D.$ If $l_x\neq l_y, l_y = \inf D = l_x.$ Suppose not. Then for any $q \in (l_x, l_y), \inf D \leq q < l_y$, which contradicts to the assumption that $l_y = \inf D$. Thus, $l_x = l_y$.
Similarly, $[r_x, r_y) \subset U$. For any $r \in [r_x, r_y)$, $r \in U.$ i.e. $r\in A.$ If $r_x \neq r_y$, $r_y = \sup A = r_x$. Suppose not. Then for any $r \in (r_x, r_y), \sup A \geq r > r_x$, which contradicts to the assumption that $\sup A = r_x$. Thus, $r_x=r_y$.  

$\therefore I_x = (l_x, r_x) = (l_y, r_y) =I_y$, which contradicts to the assumption that $I_x \neq I_y.$

$\therefore I_x = I_y \text{ or } I_x \cap I_y = \emptyset.$

Lastly, we want to show that there is one-to-one correspondence between $$\mathcal{L} :=\{I_x: x\in U \} \text{ and } \mathbb{Q}.$$ For each $I \in \mathcal{L}$, choose $r_l \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $r_l \in I.$ Such $r_l$ exists because the rational number is dense in $\mathbb{R}.$ Then for two distinct two intervals $I, J \in mathcal{L}, r_l \neq r_J$ because $I\cap J = \emptyset.$ Thus the collection of $mathcal{L}$ is at most countable. There fore $\mathcal{L}$ can be enumerated as $$\{I_j\}_{j\in A}$$ where cardinality of $A$ is at most equal to the cardinality of natural number $\mathbb{N}.$ Clearly, $U = \cup_{j\in A} I_j$.

## Definition 3.1.14
$X$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
- $U \in X$ is *open in $X$* if $\forall p \in U, \exists \epsilon >0$ such that $N_\epsilon (p) \cap X \subset U.$
- $C \subset X$ is *closed in $X$* if $X\setminus C$ is open in $X$.

## Example 3.1.15
$X=[0,\infty], U=[0,1]$. $U$ is open in $X$ because $(-1, 1) \cap X = U.$ However, $U$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}.$

## Theorem 3.1.16
(a) $U \subset X$ is open in $X$ $\iff U = X \cap O$ for some open set $O$ in $\mathbb{R}.$

(b) $C \subset X$ is closed in $X \iff C = X \cap F$ for some closed set $F$ in $\mathbb{R}.$

<*proof*>
(a) $\Rightarrow$ Since $U$ is open in $X$, $\forall p\in U, \exists\epsilon_p >0$ such that $N_{\epsilon_p}(p) \cap X \subset U.$ Define a set $O := \cup_{p \in U} N_{\epsilon_p}(p).$ Since $N_{\epsilon_p}(p)$ is open, arbitrary union of open set is open. Thus, $O$ is open. Since for every $p\in U, N_{\epsilon_p}(p) \cap X \subset U$, clearly $O\cap X \in U.$ Conversely, for every $p \in U, p\in X$ and $p\in N_{\epsilon_p}(p)$. Thus, $p \in N_{\epsilon_p}(p) \cap X$, i.e. $U\subset N_{\epsilon_p}(p) \cap X.$

$\therefore U = O \cap X.$

$\Leftarrow$ Suppose that there is open set $O$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $U=O\cap X.$ Since $O$ is open, for every $p \in U$, there is $\epsilon >0$ such that $N_\epsilon (p) \subset O.$ Then $N_\epsilon (p) \cap X \subset O\cap X = U.$

$\therefore U$ is open in $X$.

(b) Suppose that $C$ is closed in $X$. That is $X \setminus C$ is open in $X$. By (a), there is an open set $O$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $X\setminus C = X\cap O.$ Define $F := \mathbb{R} \setminus O = O^c.$ Clearly, $F$ is closed in $mathbb{R}.$

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
X\cap F &= X \cap O^c \\
&= X\setminus (X\cap O)\\
&= X \cap (X\cap C^{c}) ^c\\
&= X \cap (X^c \cup C) \\
&=(X\cap X^c) \cup (X\cap C) \\
&= X\cap C \\
&= C
\end{split}
\end{align}
$$

$\Leftarrow$ Suppose that $C=X\cap F$ for some closed $F$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
We want to show that $X\setminus C$ is open in $X$.

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
X\setminus C &= X \setminus (X\cap F)\\
&= X \cap (X\cap F)^c \\
&= X \cap (X^c \cup F^c)\\
&= (X\cap X^c) \cup (X\cap F^c) \\
&= X\cap O  
\end{split}
\end{align}
$$
By (a) $X\setminus C$ is open in $X$.

$\therefore C$ is closed in $X$.

$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Definition 3.1.17
$A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is *disconnected* if $\exists U,V$ are open sets such that $A\cap U \neq \emptyset, A\cap U \neq \emptyset, (A\cap U) \cup (A\cap V) =A,  (A \cap U) \cap (A\cap V) = \emptyset.$ $A$ is *connected* if $A$ is not disconnected.

## Theorem 3.1.18
A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected $\iff$ it is an interval

## Definition 3.2.1
$$E \subset \mathbb{R}, \{O_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$$ is a family of open sets. $$\{O_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda} is an *open cover of $E$* if $E \subset \cup_{\alpha \in \Lambda}O_\alpha.$

## Definition 3.2.3
$K \subset \mathbb{R}$ is *compact* if every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover of $K$, i.e. $$\forall \{O_\alpha \}$$ is an open cover of $K, \exists \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k \in \Lambda$ such that $K \subset O_{\alpha_1} \cup \cdots \cup O_{\alpha_k}.$

## Example 3.2.4
(a) Every finite set is compact. Let $$E=\{p_1, \cdots, p_n\}$$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $$\{O_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$$ be an open cover of E. For each $p_i \in $, we can find $O_{\alpha_i}$ such that $p_i \in O_{\alpha_i}$. Then $E \subset O_{\alpha_1} \cup \cdots \cup O_{\alpha_n}$.

$\therefore E$ is compact.

$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

(b) $(0,1)$ is not compact. $I_n := (0, 1-\frac{1}{n}).$ Then $$\{I_n\}_{n\geq2}$$ is an open cover of $(0,1)$ because $(0,1) = \cup_{n\geq 2} I_n$. Suppose that there are $I_{n_1}, \ldots, I_{n_k}$ such that $(0,1) \subset \cup_{i=1}^k I_{n_i}.$  Put $$N:=\max\{n_1, \ldots, n_k\}.$$ Then $\cup_{i=1}^k I_{n_i} = I_N = (0, 1-\frac{1}{N}) \subsetneq (0,1)$, which contradicts to the assumption.

$\therefore (0,1)$ is not compact.
