## Theorem 3.2.5
(a) $K$ is compact $\rightarrow$ $K$ is closed and bounded

(b) $K$ is compact and $F$ is closed and subset of $K$, then $F$ is compact

<*proof*>
(a) Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ be compact.  Construct an open cover as follows:
$$
O:=\{(-k,k): k \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$
Then $O$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $O$ is an open cover of $K\subset \mathbb{R}$.  Since $K$ is compact, there are $k_1, \ldots, k_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $K \subset(-k_1, k_1) \cup \cdots \cup (-k_n, k_n)$. Then take $N$ as follows:
 $$N := \max \{k_1, \ldots, k_n \}
 $$
 Then $K \subset [-N, N].$ <br />
 $\therefore K$ is bounded
 Now, we want to show that $K$ is closed. In other words, we want to show that $K^c$ is open. <br />
 Let $p \in K^c$ be given. For every $q \in K$, take $\epsilon_q >0$ such that $N_{\epsilon_q}(q) \cap N_{\epsilon_q}(p) = \emptyset.$  <br />
 Such $\epsilon_q$ does exists since we can take $\epsilon_q := \frac{|p-q|}{2}.$ Then $$\{ N_{\epsilon_q}(q): q\in K\} $$ is clearly an open cover of $K^c$. Since $K$ is compact, there are finite subcover such that $
 K \subset N_{\epsilon_{q_1}}(q_1) \cup \cdots \cup N_{\epsilon_{q_n}}(q_n).$ Then take $\epsilon >0$ as follows:
 $$
 \epsilon := \min\{ \epsilon_{q_1},\ldots, \epsilon_{q_n}\}
 $$
Since $N_\epsilon (p) \cap N_{\epsilon}(q) = \emptyset$ for all $q \in K, N_\epsilon (p) \subset K^c,$ i.e. $p \in \text{Int}(K^c)$. <br />
$\therefore K^c$ is open, i.e. $K$ is closed.
