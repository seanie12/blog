## Theorem 3.2.5
(a) $K$ is compact $\Rightarrow$ $K$ is closed and bounded

(b) $K$ is compact and $F$ is closed and subset of $K$, then $F$ is compact

<*proof*>
(a) Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ be compact.  Construct an open cover as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
O:=\{(-k,k): k \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{align}
$$
Then $O$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $O$ is an open cover of $K\subset \mathbb{R}$.  Since $K$ is compact, there are $k_1, \ldots, k_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $K \subset(-k_1, k_1) \cup \cdots \cup (-k_n, k_n)$. Then take $N$ as follows:
 $$
 \begin{align}
 N := \max \{k_1, \ldots, k_n \}
\end{align}
 $$
 Then $K \subset [-N, N].$ <br />
 $\therefore K$ is bounded
 Now, we want to show that $K$ is closed. In other words, we want to show that $K^c$ is open. <br />
 Let $p \in K^c$ be given. For every $q \in K$, take $\epsilon_q >0$ such that $N_{\epsilon_q}(q) \cap N_{\epsilon_q}(p) = \emptyset.$  <br />
 Such $\epsilon_q$ does exists since we can take $\epsilon_q := \frac{|p-q|}{2}.$ Then $$\{ N_{\epsilon_q}(q): q\in K\} $$ is clearly an open cover of $K^c$. Since $K$ is compact, there are finite subcover such that $
 K \subset N_{\epsilon_{q_1}}(q_1) \cup \cdots \cup N_{\epsilon_{q_n}}(q_n).$ Then take $\epsilon >0$ as follows:
 $$
\begin{align}
 \epsilon := \min\{ \epsilon_{q_1},\ldots, \epsilon_{q_n}\}
 \end{align}
 $$
Since $N_\epsilon (p) \cap N_{\epsilon}(q) = \emptyset$ for all $q \in K, N_\epsilon (p) \subset K^c,$ i.e. $p \in \text{Int}(K^c)$. <br />
$\therefore K^c$ is open, i.e. $K$ is closed.
 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

(b) Let $K$ be compact and let $F$ be a closed subset of $K$. Let $$\{O_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$$ be an open cover of $F$.  <br />
Then $$\{O_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in \Lambda} \cup  \{F^c\}$$ is an open cover of $K$ since $F^c$ is open.
Since $K$ is compact, there are $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \Lambda$ such that 

$$
\begin{align}
K \subset O_{\alpha_1} \cup \cdots O_{\alpha_n} \cup F^c
\end{align}
$$
$\therefore F$ has a finite subcover $$\{ O_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, O_{\alpha_n}\}$$ <br />
$\therefore F$ is compact 

 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Remark
One might think the condition that $F$ is closed not necessary. But as shown in the previous proof, it is very crucial element of proof.  
<br />
Suppose $E$ is an open cover of $F$. What we want to show is the existence of finite subcover of $E$. Given $E$, we add open sets $O_\alpha$ to E until it covers $K$. Since $K$ is compact, we can choose finite open sets $U_{\alpha_i}$ from the extended $E$ to cover $K$. Since $F$ is subset of $E$, $F$ is covered by the sets $U_{\alpha_i}$. But some $U_{\alpha_j}$ might not be in the original open cover $E$, we may choose  $U_{\alpha_j}$ such that $U_{\alpha_j} \cap F$. But if $F$ is closed, we can choose finite subcover of $E$. Since $F^c$ is open, we can add $F^c$ to $E$ and never choose such $U_{\alpha_j}$. That is why the condition is necessary.

## Theorem 3.2.2
$$\{K_n \}$$ is a sequence of nonempty compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$. Then $K:= \cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n$ is non-empty compact set.

<*proof*> Let $O_n = K^c_n$. Then $O_n$ is open because $K_n$ is closed. So it is equivalent that 

$$
\begin{align}
\cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n = \emptyset \iff \cup_{n=1}^\infty O_n = \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
$$
Suppose that $\cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n = \emptyset$. Then $$\{O_n \}_{i=1}^\infty$$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$ and is an open cover of $K_1$. Since $K_1$ is compact, there exists $n_1 <\cdots <n_k$ such that 

$$
K_1 \subset O_{n_1} \cup \cdots \cup O_{n_k}
$$
Since $O_{n_i} = K_{n_i}^c$, $K_1 \cap K_{n_1} \cap \cdots \cap K_{n_k} = \emptyset$. But it implies that $K_{n_k}$ is an  empty set, which contradicts to the assumption.
<br />
$\therefore \cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n \neq \emptyset$
<br />
Next,  we want to show that $K$ is compact. By the theorem 3.2.5, every $K_n$ is closed. Since arbitrary intersection of closed sets is also closed, $K$ is also closed.  <br />
Moreover, $K\subset K_1$ and $K_1$ is compact.
<br />
$\therefore K$ is compact

 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Theorem 3.2.8 (Heine-Borel)
Every closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$ is compact.

<*proof*>
Define an open cover of $[a,b]$ and a set $E$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{U} & :=\{U_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in \Lambda} \\
E&:= \{r \in [a,b]: [a,r] \text{ is covered by a finite number of the sets }U_\alpha\}
\end{split}
\end{align}
$$

Since $E$ is bounded above by $b$ and $E$ is a non empty set ($\because a \in E $), there is $c=\sup E$ by the least upper bound property. Then $c \leq b$.  <br />

Since $c\in [a,b]$, $c\in U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in \Lambda$.  <br />
Since $U_\beta$ is open, there is $\epsilon >0$ such that $N_\epsilon (c) \subset U_\beta.$
<br />

Now, $c-\epsilon$ is not an upper bound of $E$, so there exists $r\in E$ such that $c-\epsilon < r \leq c.$ <br /> 
So, there are $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k \in \Lambda$ such that $[a,r] \subset \cup_{i=1}^k U_{\alpha_i}$. That is $[a,c]$ is covered by the finite subcover as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
[a,c] \subset \cup_{i=1}^k U_{\alpha_i} \cup U_\beta
\end{align}
$$

$\therefore c \in E$

Now, we want to show that $c=b$. Suppose that $c   
\lneq b$. <br />
Then we can choose $c<s<b$ such that $c<s<c+\epsilon$. Then,
$$
\begin{align}
[a,s] \subset \cup_{i=1}^k U_{\alpha_i} \cup U_\beta
\end{align}
$$
$\therefore s \in E$, which contradicts the assumption that $c=\sup E$. <br />
$\therefore c=b$ <br />
$\therefore b \in E$. <br />
$\therefore [a,b]$ is compact. 

 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$
