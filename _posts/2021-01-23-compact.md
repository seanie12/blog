## Theorem 3.2.5
(a) $K$ is compact $\Rightarrow$ $K$ is closed and bounded

(b) $K$ is compact and $F$ is closed and subset of $K$, then $F$ is compact

<*Proof*>
(a) Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ be compact.  Construct an open cover as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
O:=\{(-k,k): k \in \mathbb{N} \}
\end{align}
$$
Then $O$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $O$ is an open cover of $K\subset \mathbb{R}$.  Since $K$ is compact, there are $k_1, \ldots, k_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $K \subset(-k_1, k_1) \cup \cdots \cup (-k_n, k_n)$. Then take $N$ as follows:
 $$
 \begin{align}
 N := \max \{k_1, \ldots, k_n \}
\end{align}
 $$
 Then $K \subset [-N, N].$
 
 $\therefore K$ is bounded
 
 Now, we want to show that $K$ is closed. In other words, we want to show that $K^c$ is open. 
 Let $p \in K^c$ be given. For every $q \in K$, take $\epsilon_q >0$ such that $N_{\epsilon_q}(q) \cap N_{\epsilon_q}(p) = \emptyset.$  
 
 Such $\epsilon_q$ does exist since we can take $\epsilon_q := \frac{|p-q|}{2}.$ Then $$\{ N_{\epsilon_q}(q): q\in K\} $$ is clearly an open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, there are finite subcover such that $K \subset N_{\epsilon_{q_1}}(q_1) \cup \cdots \cup N_{\epsilon_{q_n}}(q_n).$ Then take $\epsilon >0$ as follows:

 $$
\begin{align}
 \epsilon := \min\{ \epsilon_{q_1},\ldots, \epsilon_{q_n}\}
 \end{align}
 $$


Then  $N_\epsilon (p) \cap N_{\epsilon}(q_i) = \emptyset$ for all $i=1,\ldots, n$. Since $\bigcup_{i=1}^nN_{\epsilon_{q_i}}(q_i)$ is an open cover of $K, N_\epsilon (p) \subset K^c,$ i.e. $p \in \text{Int}(K^c)$.

$\therefore K^c$ is open, i.e., $K$ is closed.

 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

(b) Let $K$ be compact and let $F$ be a closed subset of $K$. Let 

$$\begin{equation*}
\{O_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
\end{equation*}
$$ 

be an open cover of $F$.  
Then 

$$
\begin{equation*}
\{O_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in \Lambda} \cup  \{F^c\}
\end{equation*}
$$ 

is an open cover of $K$ since $F^c$ is open.
Since $K$ is compact, there are $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \Lambda$ such that 

$$
\begin{align}
K \subset O_{\alpha_1} \cup \cdots O_{\alpha_n} \cup F^c
\end{align}
$$

$\therefore F$ has a finite subcover 

$$
\begin{equation*}
\{ O_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, O_{\alpha_n}\}.
\end{equation*}
$$ 

$\therefore F$ is compact 

 $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Remark
One might think the condition that $F$ is closed is not necessary. But as shown in the previous proof, it is very crucial element of proof.  

Suppose $E$ is an open cover of $F$. What we want to show is the existence of finite subcover of $E$. Given $E$, we add open sets $O_\alpha$ to E until it covers $K$. Since $K$ is compact, we can choose finite open sets $U_{\alpha_i}$ from the extended $E$ to cover $K$. Since $F$ is subset of $E$, $F$ is covered by the sets $U_{\alpha_i}$. But some $U_{\alpha_j}$ might not be in the original open cover $E$, we may choose  $U_{\alpha_j}$ such that $U_{\alpha_j} \cap F$. But if $F$ is closed, we can choose finite subcover of $E$. Since $F^c$ is open, we can add $F^c$ to $E$ and never choose such $U_{\alpha_j}$. That is why the condition is necessary.
