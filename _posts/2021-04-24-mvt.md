## Definition 5.2.1
Let $E\subset \mathbb{R}$ be a set and let $f:E\to\mathbb{R}$.

(a) $f$ has a **local maximum at $p\in E$ if there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $f(x)\leq f(p)$ for all $x\in E\cap N_\delta (p)$. The function $f$ has a **global maximum** at $p\in E$ if $f(x)\leq f(p)$ for all $x\in E$.

(b) Similarly, $f$ has a **local minimum**$$ at a point $q\in E$ if  there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $f(x)\geq f(q)$ for all $x\in E\cap N_\delta (q)$, $f$ has a **global minimum** at $q\in E$ if $f(x)\geq f(q)$ for all $x\in E$.

## Remark
As a consequence of Corollary 4.2.9, every continuous real-valued function defined on a compact subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}$ has a global maximum and minimum on $K$.

## Theorem 5.2.2
Let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function. Suppose that $f$ has either a local maximum or local minimum at $p\in \text{Int}(I)$. <br /> If $f$ is differentiable at $p$, then $f^\prime(p) = 0$.

<*proof*>
Suppose that $f$ has a local maximum and $f$ is differentiable at $p$. Then there is a $\delta>0$ such that $f(x)\leq f(p)$ for all $x\in I$ with $|x-p| <\delta$. 

If $p<x<p+\delta$, then $\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}\leq 0$.  Since $f$ is differentiable at $p$, for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\eta>0$ such that 

$$
\text{for all } x\in(x,x+\eta) \Rightarrow \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}-\epsilon<f^\prime_+(p) < \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} + \epsilon
$$

Set $\delta^\prime = \min\{\delta, \eta\}$. Then for all $x\in (x,x+\delta^\prime)$,

$$
f^\prime_+(p) < \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} + \epsilon
$$

Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, $f^\prime_+(p) \leq \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} \leq 0$.


Similarly, if $x\in (p-\delta^\prime, p)$

$$
0\leq \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}-\epsilon < f^\prime_+(p)
$$

$f^\prime_-(p)\geq 0$. Finally, since $f^\prime_+(p)=f^\prime_-(p) = f^\prime(p)$, we have $f^\prime(p) =0$. The proof of the case where $f$ has a local minimum at $p$ is similar.

$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Corollary 5.2.3
Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function on $[a,b]$. If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $p\in (a,b)$, then either the derivative of $f$ at $p$ does not exists, or $f^\prime(p)=0$.

## Remark 
The conclusion of Theorem 5.2. is not valid if $p\in I$ is an endpoint of the interval. For example, if $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ has a local maximum at $a$, and if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then we can only conclude that $f^\prime(a) =f^\prime_+(a) \leq 0$.

## Theorem 5.2.5 (Rolle's Theorem)
Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function on $[a,b]$ with $f(a) = f(b)$, and that $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$.  Then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that $f^\prime(c) = 0$.

<*proof*>
If $f$ is constant function on $[a,b]$, then we are done. <br /> Suppose that $f$ is not constant. Since $[a,b]$ is compact and $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $f$ has a global maximum and global minimum on $[a,b]$ by Corollary 4.2.9.

If $f(t) > f(a)$ for some $t\in (a,b)$, then $f$ has a maximum at some $c\in (a,b)$. Thus, by Theorem 5.2.2, $f^\prime(c) =0$. If $f^\prime (t) < f(a)$ for some $t$, then $f$ has a minimum at some $c\in (a,b)$, and again $f^\prime(c)=0$.

$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Theorem 5.2.6 (Mean Value Theorem)
If $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that 

$$
f(b)-f(a) = f^\prime(c) (b-a)
$$

<*proof*>
Define $g(x) := f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a)$. Then $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g(a)=0=g(b)$.

By Rolle's Theorem, there is $c\in (a,b)$ such that $g^\prime (c) = 0$ for some $c\in (a,b)$.

$$
g^\prime(x) = f^\prime(x) -\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$

$\therefore f^\prime(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.
$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Example 5.2.7
Prove that $\frac{x}{1+x}\leq \log(1+x)\leq x$ for all $x>-1$

<*proof*>
Define $f(x):=\log(1+x)$. Then $f(0)=0$. Suppose that $x>0$. Then $f:[0,x]\to\mathbb{R}$. 

$$
f^\prime(c) = \frac{1}{1+c} = \frac{ \log (1+x)}{x} \text{ for some }c\in (0,x)
$$

Since $c>0, \frac{1}{1+c}<1$. <br />
$\therefore \log(1+x) < x$

$$
1+x > 1+c \Rightarrow \frac{1}{1+x} < \frac{1}{1+c} = \frac{\log(1+x)}{x}
$$

$\therefore \frac{x}{1+x} < \log (1+x)$.

For $-1<x<0$,

$$
f^\prime(c) = \frac{1}{1+c} = \frac{\log(1+x)}{x} \text{ for some } c\in(x,0)
$$

Since $-1<x<c<0, 1<\frac{1}{1+c}<\frac{1}{1+x}$, and since $x<0$

$$
\frac{x}{1+x} < \log (1+x) < x
$$ 

Hence the desired inequality holds for all $x>-1$ with equality if and only if $x=0$.
$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Theorem 5.2.8 (Cauchy Mean Value Theorem)
If $f,g$ are continuous real-valued functions on $[a,b]$ that are differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that 

$$
\left[f(b) -f(a) \right]g^\prime(c) = \left[g(b)-g(a) \right]f^\prime(c).
$$

<*proof*>
Let

$$
h(x) = [f(b) - f(a)]g(x) - [g(b)-g(a)]f(x)
$$

Then $h$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ with

$$
h(a) = f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(b) = h(b)
$$

Thus by Rolle's theorem, there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that $h^\prime(c) =0$, which gives the result.
$$\tag*{$\square$}$$

## Theorem 5.2.9
Suppose $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable on the interval $I$.
